    of the imaging process, up to factor of scale, using the
    assumption of reci- procity. With the known response function, the
    algorithm can fuse themultiple photographs into a single, high
    dynamic range radiance map whose pixel values are proportional to
    the true radiance values in the scene. We demonstrate our method
    on images acquired with both photochemical and digital imaging
    processes. We discuss how this work is applicable in many areas of
    computer graphics involv- ing digitized photographs, including
    image-based modeling, image compositing, and image processing.
    Lastly, we demonstrate a few applications of having high dynamic
    range radiance maps, such as synthesizing realistic motion blur
    and simulating the response of the human visual system.},

  abstract     = {An image acquired by a camera consists of measured
    intensity values which are related to scene radiance by a function
    called the camera response function. Knowledge of this response is
    necessary for computer vision algorithms which depend on scene
    radiance. One way the response has been determined is by
    establishing a mapping of intensity values between images taken
    with different exposures. We call this mapping the intensity
    mapping function. In this paper, we address two basic questions.
    What information from a pair of images taken at different
    exposures is needed to determine the intensity mapping function?
    Given this function, can the response of the camera and the
    exposures of the images be determined? We completely determine the
    ambiguities associated with the recovery of the response and the
    ratios of the exposures. We show all methods that have been used
    to recover the response break these ambiguities by making
    assumptions on the exposures or on the form of the response. We
    also show when the ratio of exposures can be recovered directly
    from the intensity mapping, without recovering the response. We
    show that the intensity mapping between images is determined
    solely by the intensity histograms of the images. We describe how
    this allows determination of the intensity mapping between images
    without registration. This makes it possible to determine the
    intensity mapping in sequences with some motion of both the camera
    and objects in the scene.},

  abstract     = {High contrast images are common in night scenes and
    other scenes that include dark shadows and bright light sources.
    These scenes are difficult to display because their contrasts
    greatly exceed the range of most display devices for images. As a
    result, the image constrasts are compressed or truncated,
    obscuring subtle textures and details. Humans view and understand
    high contrast scenes easily, ``adapting'' their visual response to
    avoid compression or truncation with no apparent loss of detail.
    By imitating some of these visual adaptation processes, we
    developed methods for the improved display of high-contrast
    images. The first builds a display image from several layers of
    lighting and surface properties. Only the lighting layers are
    compressed, drastically reducing contrast while preserving much of
    the image detail. This method is practical only for synthetic
    images where the layers can be retained from the rendering
    process. The second method interactively adjusts the displayed
    image to preserve local contrasts in a small ``foveal''
    neighborhood. Unlike the first method, this technique is usable on
    any image and includes a new tone reproduction operator. Both
    methods use a sigmoid function for contrast compression. This
    function has no effect when applied to small signals but
    compresses large signals to fit within an asymptotic limit. We
    demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches by comparing
    processed and unprocessed images.},
